# ravelens

ravelens is the social media for ravers, where you can add all your favourite festival pics and see your friend's posts as well. This was made as a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxXyfkrP298&t=16804s&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery) to learn react and it was edited after completing the tutorial to make it personal.
